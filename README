TX is a simple game engine I wrote for a uni project.
It is written in C++, OpenGL. Uses MiniXML, QT, Lua, LuaBind, DevIL and rcbc for COLLADA model parsing/rendering. It is fairly old 'learning' code, with bugs and oddities and is not being maintained.

To build:
=========
scons

You can also compile with debug information:
scons debug=1

It is also possible to build for a win32 target under Linux but it requires mingw correctly setup with the libraries:
scons win32=1

Usage:
======
./tx

The following libraries are required:
=====================================
rcbc (see https://github.com/dcbishop/)
glut (freeglut3-dev)
libluabind-dev
liblua5.1-0-dev
libmxml-dev
libdevil-dev
